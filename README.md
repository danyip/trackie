# Trackie

Trackie my "fisher price" expedition into fullstack development.
It's a project tracking application that allows users to create, assign and manage their projects and tasks.

Tasks can be given a due date, priority and status; as well as being assigned to a user to complete.
As the individual tasks get completed the progress of their parent project is automatically updated in the UI to reflect the overall progress of the project.

Users can also create and assign themselves with skills to help other users when selecting them for tasks.
